# QUICK-ITEM-DATABASE
QIDB is a database for minecraft bedrock's script Api.

This database aims to avoid the use of `JSON.stringify()` for saving `ItemStack` and `ItemStack[]`. It works with structures by saving the items in .NBT format, thus obtaining perfect clones of the items in a simple and fast way.
